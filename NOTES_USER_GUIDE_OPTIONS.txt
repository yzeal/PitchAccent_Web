# User Guide & Options Menu Notes

## User Guide
- Supported file formats for different browsers and platforms
- Warning about sudden volume change when recording on iOS, especially with headphones
- On iOS, pitch extraction from .mov and some video files may not work; recommend using .mp3, .wav, or .m4a audio files or converting videos before use
- All browsers on iOS (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.) have the same audio and media limitations due to WebKit; there is no workaround in web apps
- If audio output volume is stuck after recording on iOS, try reloading the page or closing the tab to restore normal volume control

## Options Menu (future ideas)
- Customizable loop delay for native and user recordings
- Adjustable y-axis range and auto-fit options for pitch graphs
- Toggle for showing/hiding playback indicator on pitch graphs
- Option to select audio input/output devices (where supported)
- Option to choose smoothing/filtering method for pitch curves
- Keyboard shortcuts customization
- **Microphone selection dropdown for desktop browsers only** (use `enumerateDevices` and `getUserMedia` with `deviceId`; hide on mobile for cleaner UI and because it's not supported)
